Welcome to The Happiness Habit!

Track your habits and see which ones correlate with your happiest days.

To mark a task as completed on a particular day, click the appropriate circle.  When the circle is marked in blue, you know you have achieved that habit for that day!

To use the journal functionality, first mark off all of the tasks you have completed today.  Then write a journal entry about how you felt, thoughts you had, etc, and click submit.  Google's Natural Language API will then 'read' your entry, assign it a positive, neutral, or negative value, and then appropriately score the habits you had completed on the day of the journal entry.  Keep an eye on the Habits Ranked by Happiness Section - that's where you'll see which habits have the strongest correlation to happy days!  

Please note that only one journal entry per day will be scored for mood, so the Happiness Habit works best if you write the journal entry at the end of the day.
